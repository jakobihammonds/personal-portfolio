          <h2>WHY I CHOSE THIS PATH</h2>
          <p>It sounds cliche, but I grew up working on computers and cars with my brother and dad as a kid. 
            I had a period in my life where I lost all my interest in coding, sports, and just everything, it felt like I was a different kid.
          I made the decision to pick football up again, and it's one of the best decisions of my life, 
          I picked up all of my old hobbies like they had never left, and I enjoy them more than ever.
